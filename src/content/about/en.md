## About me

My name is Piotr Tymoteusz Trybisz, I am 19 years old, and I am studying Computer Science at the Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics at the Gdańsk University of Technology. 
I've always been interested in computers. 
I started my adventure with programming when I was a child, playing with VBA macros in Excel. 
In the fourth grade of primary school, I started programming AVR microcontrollers in C and C ++. 
Then I also created the first window applications using C # and Windows Forms / WPF. 
In junior high school, I learned to create websites in HTML, CSS, JS. 
In high school, I mastered several frameworks - React, Svelte, TailwindCSS and TypeScript. 
During a group project on the basics of entrepreneurship, I also learned the Python language, which allowed me to easily write my final exams in computer science at 98%, as well as the Django framework. 
In the future, I would like to work as a programmer, especially in web technologies, as a front-end, back-end, or full-stack developer.
I am an active member of the IT Commission of Student Self - Government of the Gdańsk University of Technology, where I am working, among others, on the Student Discount Card, and the Ping Cyber-security and Network Scientific Circle.
